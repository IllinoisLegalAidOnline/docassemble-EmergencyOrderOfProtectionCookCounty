subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need to know: 

  * A safe mailing address where the court can contact you,
  * Information about people you want to protect,
  * Details about the abuser, including where they can be found,
  * Details about the abuse and when it happened,
  * What property and places you want to protect, and
  * Information about other court cases involving you and the abuser, if known.

  If you have children with the abuser, you also need to know:
  
  * School or daycare information, and
  * How you want the court to restrict parenting time, if any.
  
  **Important:** To email your forms to the clerk for a remote hearing during after-hours, you also need:
  
  * A safe email address where the court coordinator can contact you, and
  * A phone or computer where you can use Zoom for a remote video court hearing. [**Download the Zoom app**](https://zoom.us/download) before your after-hours court hearing.

  Set aside 15 to 30 minutes to finish this program. You can login and save your work to continue later.

continue button field: who_can_be_protected
question: |
  Who can get an Order of Protection
subquestion: |
  You can ask for an Order of Protection if you have been abused by a current or ex-romantic partner or a family or household member, such as a:
  
  * Current or ex-spouse,
  * Person with whom you live or used to live,
  * Parent of your child,
  * Relative by blood,
  * Related through a current or a prior marriage,
  * Relative of your child (includes relatives of your foster child, adopted child or prospective adopted child, or relatives of a child for whom you are the legally-appointed guardian or legally-appointed custodian), or
  * Caregiver for persons with disabilities.

  You can also ask for an Order of Protection if you are filing for any person who has been abused by a family or household member, but is unable to file on their own. This could be a minor child or a person with disabilities.

  There are many kinds of abuse. To learn more, read ILAO's [**Domestic violence common questions**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/185806).

id: important op info
continue button field: important_op_info
question: |
  Things you should know
subquestion: |
  The person who caused the abuse is called the **Respondent**. In court, the judge will use this word to refer to the abuser. This program and the forms will do the same.

  **You will need to include an address where the Respondent can be found.** This is so the sheriff can deliver the court papers. Delivery of the court papers is called **service.** This might be where the Respondent lives, works, or a place where they stay. **Note: the Respondent will get a copy of all the court forms, except for the ones that are confidential like school or daycare location.**

  You will need to list an address on your court forms. **If you do not want the Respondent to know where you are staying, or if you do not have a home address, you can list a different safe mailing address where you will receive court documents.**

  **The Order of Protection is not valid until signed by a judge.** You must go to court, either in person or remotely, where a judge will decide whether or not to grant you an Order of Protection.
